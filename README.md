# 💫 About Me

Hi, I’m **Prathmesh Ingole** 👋  
A Data Analyst in training with a strong foundation in Computer Science, Python, SQL, and data visualization.

I enjoy working with data to uncover insights, build dashboards, and support data-driven decision making. Alongside analytics, I have hands-on experience in web development and database management, which helps me understand systems end to end.

I’ve worked on real-world projects like sales analysis and a vehicle breakdown assistance platform, and completed industry-recognized virtual internships with Deloitte and Tata through Forage. I believe in learning by doing and continuously improving my technical and analytical skills.
